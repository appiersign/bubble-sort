# Advanced Building Blocks - Bubble Sort
> In this project, we implemented the bubble sort algorithm.  Bubble Sort is one of the simpler sorting algorithms.  It sorts a group of items in an array by comparing the item on the left to the item its direct right, if the item on the left is larger, the two items swap positions.    In this project we also had to focus on the use of yield and passing a block to a method.


## Built With
